question-Write a program to print the product of even numbers from 1 to n.
answer-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i;
    unsigned long long product = 1;  // Use long long for large results

    // Input n
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Check if there is at least one even number
    if (n < 2) {
        printf("No even numbers in the range 1 to %d\n", n);
        return 0;
    }

    // Calculate product of even numbers from 2 to n
    for (i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
        product *= i;
    }

    printf("Product of even numbers from 1 to %d is: %llu\n", n, product);

    return 0;
}
