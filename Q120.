question-Write a program to take an integer array as input. Only one element will be repeated. Print the repeated element. Try to find the result in one single iteration.
answer-#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int arr[n];
    int freq[n];  // since array contains numbers in range 0 to n-1

    // initialize freq to 0
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        freq[i] = 0;

    int repeated = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);

        if (freq[arr[i]] == 1) {
            repeated = arr[i];
            break;  // found the repeated number in the same iteration
        }

        freq[arr[i]]++;
    }

    printf("%d", repeated);

    return 0;
}
