question-Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.
answer-#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter a positive integer n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2; // Sum of 1 to n
    int leftSum = 0;
    int pivot = -1;

    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        leftSum += x;             // Sum from 1 to x
        int rightSum = totalSum - (leftSum - x); // Sum from x to n
        if (leftSum == rightSum) {
            pivot = x;
            break; // Only one pivot exists
        }
    }

    printf("Pivot integer: %d\n", pivot);

    return 0;
}
