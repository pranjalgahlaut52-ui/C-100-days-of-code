question-Write a program to take a string s as input. The task is to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Print the length as output.
answer-#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char s[1000];
    scanf("%s", s);

    int n = strlen(s);
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int freq[256] = {0};
        int currLen = 0;

        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            if (freq[(unsigned char)s[j]] == 1) {
                break;  // Repeated character found
            }
            freq[(unsigned char)s[j]] = 1;
            currLen++;
        }

        if (currLen > maxLen)
            maxLen = currLen;
    }

    printf("%d", maxLen);
    return 0;
}
